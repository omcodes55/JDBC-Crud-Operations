# JDBC-Crud-Operations

ðŸš€ Project: JDBC CRUD Operations
I built a project showcasing JDBC CRUD operations, including creating databases and tables, inserting, updating, retrieving, and deleting records. This helped me strengthen my skills in Java database integration and SQL optimization. Excited to expand this further with frameworks like Spring Boot!
